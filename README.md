The dataset is obtained from a recommender system prototype from UCI Machine Learning Repository of Restaurant and Consumer data Data Set. The task is to generate a top-n list of restaurants according to the consumer preferences.

The ability of these engines to recommend personalized content, based on past behavior is incredible. It brings customer delight and gives them a reason to keep returning to the website.

I will get some intuition into how recommendation work and create basic popularity model and a collaborative filtering model.

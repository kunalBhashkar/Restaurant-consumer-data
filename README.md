# Restaurant-consumer-data
1. Introduction

The dataset is obtained from a recommender system prototype from UCI Machine Learning Repository of Restaurant and Consumer data Data Set. The task is to generate a top-n list of restaurants according to the consumer preferences.
Be it a fresher or an experienced professional in data science my main purpose to write this article is to get your started with recommendation systems so that you can build one. 
We can simply say that Recommendation engines are nothing but just an automated form of a person who is sitting at shop counter and predict about customer on the basis of their previous experience or customer choice. If customer ask him for a product then he not only to show that product, but also the related ones which you could buy. They are well trained in cross selling and up selling. So, does our recommendation engines.
The ability of these engines to recommend personalized content, based on past behavior is incredible. It brings customer delight and gives them a reason to keep returning to the website. In this post, I will cover the fundamentals of creating a recommendation system using in Python. I will get some intuition into how recommendation work and create basic popularity model and a collaborative filtering model.

2. Data Set and Attribute Information
Here i am using the data set of Reataurant and consumer data Data set which has been collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository (Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data). The basic information about this data set is it has total nine csv file in which five of them have Restaurant category, three are from customer category and one is from rating category.
